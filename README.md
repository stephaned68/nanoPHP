# nanoPHP 
nanoPHP is a lightweight framework using PHP 7+ and the MVC pattern.
It does not include an ORM but schema and query builder classes, a simple database migrations system, and a form builder and manager. It uses PDO to access the database (MySQL, Postgres and SQLite are currently supported) as well as the jQuery javascript library and the Bootstrap CSS library.
